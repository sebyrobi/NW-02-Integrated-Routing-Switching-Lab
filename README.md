## Project Overview

This project is a multi-device networking lab completed under timed, high-pressure conditions. I configured:  

- VLANs and SVIs on switches, including VLAN 16 (Captain) and VLAN 17 (Tennille)  
- Router-on-a-Stick interVLAN routing with sub-interfaces  
- Static routes and default routes for network traffic  
- DHCP for VLAN 17 hosts, reserving addresses .1–.15  
- Switchport security on designated ports  
- Verified connectivity across all devices  

The topology was **recreated independently**, demonstrating ability to reproduce a network from instructions. Diagrams showing the recreated network are included in the `diagrams/` folder.  

> Note: The original Packet Tracer file from the lab could not be included due to exam content restrictions.

## Instructions / How to Review

1. Check the `configs/` folder for router, switch, and PC configuration files.  
2. Review the `diagrams/` folder for the recreated topology.  
3. Look at the `screenshots/` folder to verify VLANs, interVLAN routing, DHCP assignment, and switch security.  
4. PCs in VLAN 16 and VLAN 17 are set to obtain IP addresses automatically via DHCP.

## Key Takeaways

- Demonstrates CCNA-level skills under **timed, high-pressure conditions**  
- Multi-device setup integrating VLANs, routing, DHCP, static routes, and switch security  
- Screenshots and configs provide evidence of working connectivity and correct configurations  
- Shows ability to **reproduce and verify a complex network independently**
