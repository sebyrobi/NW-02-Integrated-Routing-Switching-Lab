# NW-02-Integrated-Routing-Switching-Lab

Project: Integrated VLAN and Routing Lab  
Skills: VLANs, InterVLAN Routing, DHCP, Static Routing, Switch Security, Device Configuration  
Completion: 85%

---

## Project Overview

This lab demonstrates end-to-end networking across multiple devices:  

- Configured VLANs and SVI interfaces  
- Router-on-a-Stick interVLAN routing  
- DHCP for VLAN 17 (host assignment)  
- Static routes and default route configuration  
- Switchport security on designated ports  
- Verified connectivity across all devices  

The topology was **recreated independently**, showing ability to reproduce a network from instructions.

## Key Takeaways

- Demonstrates **CCNA-level skills** under **time constraints**  
- Multi-device setup integrating routing, switching, VLANs, DHCP, and security  
- Screenshots, diagrams, and configs provide evidence of **working connectivity and proper configurations**

## Instructions / How to Review

1. Open the Packet Tracer file to explore the network.  
2. Check the `configs/` folder for router, switch, and PC configurations.  
3. Review the `diagrams/` folder for your topology and recreated diagram.  
4. Look at the `screenshots/` folder for connectivity, VLANs, DHCP, and switch security verification.
